# analyzeRepeatSequences

<!-- badges: start -->

This package involves:
  - Visualizing a multiple sequence alignment of repetitive sequences.
  - Summarizing a multiple sequence alignment into stacked bar plot of repeat unit frequencies.
  - Calculating a consensus sequence from related sequences.
  - Determining variable segments of repetitive sequences.
  
Steps preceding use of this package:
  1. Run Tandem Repeats Finder https://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html
  2. Parse its output
  3. Lump infrequent repeat units into fewer categories
  4. Convert each repeat unit to a single character
  5. Multiple sequence alignment
  6. Convert alignment to table
Examples of these steps are available in the repo [TODO link repo](https://github.com/)

The output table from step 6 above has the following format:
        
        unitorders_df
        
        A parsed multiple sequence alignment. Each row is one repeat unit. Rows are ordered by individual.
        Within an individual, rows are ordered from bottom to top in the 5' to 3' direction.
        
        Columns:
              character: repeat unit encoded as a single ASCII character (character)
              sample: individual sequence ID (character)
              count: width of each repeat unit on the plot (numeric)
              seq: sequence of repeat unit
              gp: integer that increments one every row over the ungrouped dataframe. 
                  This gives every repeat unit in a sequence its own position, 
                  rather than clustering identical units together (integer)
              group: used with plotSubgroups = T to cluster sequences in the plot

## Installation

You can install the development version of analyzeRepeatSequences from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ramoya/analyzeRepeatSequences")
```

## Quick example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(analyzeRepeatSequences)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
